KIOSK DESKTOP – WINDOWS INSTRUCTIONS (SERVER + UI IN ONE)
========================================================

PREREQUISITE: INSTALL NODE.JS (ONCE)
------------------------------------
1) Download and run the official Node.js installer (LTS/current works; use this build):
   https://nodejs.org/dist/v22.20.0/node-v22.20.0-x64.msi
2) Accept the defaults. When it finishes, close and reopen Command Prompt/PowerShell.
3) Verify:
   node -v
   npm -v
   (Both should print versions; if not, restart Windows and try again.)


FOLDER YOU WILL RECEIVE
-----------------------
kiosk-electron-node-selfhost\
  Start Kiosk (Windows).cmd         <-- double-click this to run the kiosk
  main.js
  package.json
  README.md
  media\                            <-- DROP YOUR VIDEOS/IMAGES HERE
  renderer\
    index.html
    app.js
    styles.css

    static-center-banner.png


HOW TO RUN (VENDOR-FRIENDLY)
----------------------------
1) Unzip the folder anywhere (e.g., C:\\kiosk-electron-node-selfhost\\).
2) Double-click: Start Kiosk (Windows).cmd
   • On first run, it will download a local Electron runtime (via npx). Internet is required for this step only.
   • A window opens at 960x1280 in the top-left of your primary display.
   • You will see placeholders in all cells initially.
3) Drag and drop your media files into the media\\ folder.
   • Supported video: .mp4 .mov .webm .m4v .ogg
   • Supported image: .jpg .jpeg .png .gif .webp .avif
   • The app rescans every 60 seconds and picks up new files automatically.
   • Landscape videos are auto-rotated 90° to fill the portrait cells.
   • A placeholder image is always shown per cell while the media loads.
4) To stop the app, close the kiosk window. To restart, double-click the .cmd again.


OVERVIEW
--------
This package runs a small local server (built-in; no Express or extra installs)
and an Electron window to display the 4x3 mosaic. You can drag and drop media
files into the 'media' folder at any time. The app rescans automatically.

No admin rights are required beyond installing Node.js once.
No global installs are required for the app itself.


WHAT YOU NEED
-------------
• Windows 10 or 11
• Internet on first launch (to fetch a local Electron runtime via npx)
• Node.js installed (see the prerequisite above)
• A GPU/driver that can play MP4/H.264 video smoothly (typical modern Windows PCs are fine)


DISPLAY / LAYOUT
----------------
• Window size: 960 x 1280 (3:4 aspect).
• Grid: 4 columns x 3 rows.
• The middle row has a center banner that spans two columns.
• Styling is controlled by renderer\styles.css and matches the provided spec.


MEDIA SELECTION LOGIC
---------------------
• Every refresh (default: 60 seconds), the app:
  1) Randomizes all available media.
  2) Picks 10 items for the cells.
  3) Avoids repeating items from the immediately previous round.
  4) Never permanently excludes anything; items can return in later refreshes.
• If there are fewer than 10 media items, the app will fill what it can and keep placeholders for the rest.


CENTER BANNER
-------------
• The center banner image is renderer\static-center-banner.png.
• Replace it with any image of your choice (keep the same filename).


MIRROR OPTION
-------------
• By default, mirroring is off.
• If you need to mirror horizontally, contact us to enable it in the configuration.


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
• Window doesn’t open / Electron not found:
  - Ensure Node.js is installed and you double-clicked “Start Kiosk (Windows).cmd” inside the unzipped folder.
  - First run requires internet (npx downloads a local Electron runtime).
• Media not appearing:
  - Ensure files are in the media\ folder (same level as Start Kiosk (Windows).cmd).
  - Wait up to 60 seconds for the auto-refresh (or relaunch the app to force a rescan).
  - Check that the file extensions are supported.
  - Filenames with spaces are supported.
• Placeholders don’t disappear:
  - The placeholder remains visible until each image/video is ready to render.
  - For videos, autoplay requires them to be muted (the app mutes them automatically).
• Window position/size:
  - Default is 960x1280 at top-left. If you need a different size/position or full-screen mapping, contact us for a variant launcher.
• Logs:
  - If requested, press Ctrl+Shift+I to open DevTools, then check “Console” and “Network” for load errors.


OPTIONAL – BUILD A SINGLE .EXE INSTALLER (FOR IT/OPS)
-----------------------------------------------------
(Do this on a Windows machine; only needed if you want a click-to-install executable
that bundles Electron so first-run internet isn’t required.)
1) Open Command Prompt in the folder (Shift + Right-Click → “Open PowerShell/Terminal here”).
2) Run:
   npm install
   npm run dist:win
3) Output:
   .\dist\Kiosk Setup 1.0.0.exe
4) Hand that .exe to the vendor.


SUPPORT
-------
If you have questions or need a full-screen/top-left variant for a 3840x2160 wall,
let us know and we’ll provide an alternate launcher without changing your workflow.
